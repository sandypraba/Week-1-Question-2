# Week-1-Question-2

Your DevOps team is responsible for automating the deployment of a web application. You have a Jenkins server setup, and your team follows a CI/CD pipeline for deployments.

Question:

How would you allocate the task of adding a new feature to the web application to a developer and ensure it's integrated into the CI/CD pipeline?

Task 1: Explain how to create a new task or user story for the feature


•	Log in to your issue tracking system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) where you manage your project's tasks and user stories.
•	Jira: Click on the "+ Create" button at the top of the project board, then select "Task" or "User Story." Fill in the required information, including a clear and concise title, a detailed description of the feature, and any acceptance criteria that define when the task is complete.
•	GitHub Issues: Click on the "New Issue" button in the repository's "Issues" tab. Provide a descriptive title and a thorough description of the feature. You can also use checkboxes for acceptance criteria.
•	Assign appropriate labels, components, or categories to the task or user story to help organize and prioritize it. You might use labels like "feature," "enhancement," or similar to distinguish it as a new feature.
•	Indicate the priority level of the task/user story to convey its importance relative to other work items.
•	Attach any relevant documents, wireframes, or design mockups to provide context for the feature. You can also reference related issues, such as dependencies or related bug reports.
•	Click the "Create" or "Submit" button to create the task or user story. It will now be part of your project's backlog.

Task 2: Describe how to assign the task to a developer and communicate the requirements.


•	Open the newly created task or user story within your issue tracking system.
•	Jira: Look for the "Assignee" field on the issue details page. Click on it and select the developer from the dropdown list or start typing their name to search for them.
•	GitHub Issues: On the issue details page, click the "Assignees" section on the right side. Start typing the developer's GitHub username or name, and select them from the suggestions.
•	Use the issue's description and acceptance criteria to clearly communicate what needs to be done.
•	You can also use comments in the issue to discuss specific details, answer questions, or provide additional context.
•	Mention the developer's username in comments or via to ensure they receive notifications about updates and discussions related to the task.
•	After selecting the developer and providing clear requirements, save the changes. The developer will now be responsible for the task and receive notifications.


Task 3: Outline the steps to integrate the new feature into the CI/CD pipeline, including creating a branch, writing tests, and updating the Jenkins pipeline configuration.


•	Using the command line, run git checkout -b feature-branch where "feature-branch" is a descriptive name for your branch.
•	Ensure your local repository is up-to-date with the latest changes from the main or development branch by running git pull from the main branch before creating the new branch.
•	Develop the new feature according to the requirements specified in the task or user story.
•	Write automated tests to ensure the new feature functions correctly and does not introduce regressions in existing functionality. These tests should cover both positive and negative scenarios.
•	Push your feature branch to the remote repository with git push origin feature-branch.
•	Access the Jenkins server and navigate to the job or pipeline configuration that deploys your web application.
•	Modify the pipeline configuration to include the new feature branch. This typically involves specifying the branch name and configuring any necessary build and deployment steps.
•	Ensure that the Jenkins job is set to trigger automatically when changes are pushed to the feature branch.
•	When Jenkins automatically triggers the job for the feature branch, it should build, test, and deploy the application with the new feature.
•	Review the CI/CD pipeline's logs and reports to ensure the feature was successfully integrated and deployed without issues
•	After successful testing and review, create a pull request  to merge the feature branch into the main or development branch.
